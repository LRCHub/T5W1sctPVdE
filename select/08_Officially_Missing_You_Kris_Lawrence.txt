Oh Baby I've been missing you

All I hear is raindrops, falling on the rooftop
Oh Baby tell me why'd you have to go
Cause this pain I feel it won't go away
And today, I'm officially missing you
Oh can't nobody do it like you? said every little thing you dou
Hey Baby said it stays on my mind, that I...
I'm officially missing you

Don't wanna miss today

Well I thought I could just get over you baby
But i see there's something i just can't do
From the way you would hold me, to the sweet thing you told me
I just can't find a way to let go of you
Oh can't nobody do it like you? said every little thing you do
Chueokgi dwel oneurege, Say I...

Oh can't nobody do it like you said every little thing you do
